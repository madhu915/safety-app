In a diverse state like Tamil Nadu, which is home to millions of people it can be difficult for the government to keep an eye on every nook and corner of the streets. Chennai, being one of the highly populated cities of Tamil Nadu faces the same issue as well. The number of crimes committed against women has always been higher. These offenses include kidnapping, murder, acid attacks, sexual assault, catcalling and many more. The majority of the time, offenders select remote locations and small streets with little to no CCTV coverage and a significantly less volume of pedestrian traffic. This problem is addressed by the WSA application, which targets to classify routes as safe and unsafe, providing users with a safe route and other options like sharing current location and sending SOS to police stations, to reach their intended destination safely.
